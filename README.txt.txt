This code takes an input of up to 30 numbers and sorts them using a bubble sort method. The node.h file declares the amount of space needed for each method, and then node.c defines how each function executes. 

INSTRUCTIONS: In the main file, you can continue to enter numbers up to 30 times. But if you wish to end early, you may simply type -1, and this will sort all the numbers inputed (excluding the -1).

FOR EXAMPLE: If you input 30 20 50 70 10 -1, the the program will output
	
	Original List:
	30 <==> 20 <==> 50 <==> 70 <==> 10

	Succesful Sort:
	10 <==> 20 <==> 30 <==> 50 <==> 70

EXISTING BUGS: Do not input string input into the sort algorithm, as it is currently only able to sort numbers.
